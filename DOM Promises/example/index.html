				<p>A few operations with <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> can be asynchronous &ndash; the initial render, plus <code>set()</code>, <code>animate()</code>, <code>update()</code> and <code>teardown()</code>.</p>

				<p>They're asynchronous if they cause one or more <a href='https://github.com/Rich-Harris/Ractive/wiki/Transitions'>transitions</a> that are themselves asynchronous. In these cases, you often want to execute some code once the operation is complete.</p>

				<p>Normally, you achieve this by passing a <em>callback</em>, e.g. <code>ractive.set( 'foo', bar, doSomething )</code>. But this can get unwieldy when you're trying to chain lots of operations together in a complex fashion.</p>

				<p>Because of these situations, in recent years '<a href='http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/'>promises</a>' (and deferreds, which are similar) have become increasingly popular. <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> doesn't support promises 'out of the box' because there are so many different implementations, but it's easy to make it work with your promise library of choice.</p>
